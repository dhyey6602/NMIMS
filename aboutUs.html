                    <p>We are NMIMS Global Access School For Continuing Education &#8211; India&#8217;s No.1 Distance
                        Management University. From being the country’s premiere distance-learning establishment of the
                        20th century to crafting a 21st-century ready online education platform, our journey has been
                        dynamic and gratifying. Thousands of students have graduated from NGA-SCE and are now fulfilling
                        their hopes and dreams. </p>
                    <p>SVKM’s NMIMS was founded in 1981 and by 2003, they were awarded the ‘Deemed-to-be-University’
                        status. However, by 1994, it had become clear that the youth of urban and rural India were
                        looking for quality education, which would supplement their professional career without them
                        having to attend traditional classroom-based courses. </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class=" mx-4">This insight marked the birth of NGA-SCE, an establishment with a core focus on online and
                distance learning.
                Thus, a merger between technology and academic prowess created a more student-centric platform, and
                today,
                we can proudly claim that all our lectures are 100% online. Our programs are designed to help working
                professionals advance in their career and enhance their employability. To make the enrolment process
                easier,
                we are spread across 30 cities in India with 9 regional offices and over 80 Authorised Enrolment
                Partners.

                    <p>NMIMS was established in 1981 by Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal with the help of a donation from
                        Narsee Monjee Educational Trust as a Management Institute affiliated to University of Mumbai.
                        Today, NMIMS is one of the top 10 B-schools in India. In 1994, we opened our doors to students
                        who were looking to balance their education and work. Currently, we have grown to 55,000+
                        students &amp; have 9,500 strong alumni. Even though we have been in the field of education for
                        the last 3 decades, it feels like our journey has only begun.</p>
